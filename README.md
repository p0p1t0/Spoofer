 ## Buy a pincode üîë
 
Pincodes are codes that allow you to use the *Email spoofer* and *SMS spoofer* tools from the Spoofer application. For each email or SMS sent it will cost you ‚Ç¨1 and the **minimum purchase of a pincode is ‚Ç¨30**, which would be equivalent to 30 email/SMS sendings. With purchases equal to or greater than ‚Ç¨200, the value of each send will cost ‚Ç¨0.50, so if you buy a pincode for ‚Ç¨200 you will have 400 email/SMS sendings.

Currently accepted payment methods: **Bitcoin**.

Email: **contact@p0p1t0.com**

Telegram: **https://t.me/p0p1t0telegram**

Note: Keep in mind that if you send me the exact amount of ‚Ç¨30 in BTC, I will not receive exactly ‚Ç¨30 due to transaction fees, therefore I will give you the amount that I receive. If I receive, for example, ‚Ç¨25 in BTC, I will give you 25 sendings.
